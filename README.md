# FirstProject
Hello I'm learning C++ and in order to do that I decided to create my first porject.

Project: Task Manager.

You can create a program that allows the user to manage his daily tasks. The program can offer the following features:

- Add a task: allows the user to add a new task by entering its name and due date.

- Delete task: allows the user to delete an existing task by entering its name.

- Show all tasks: displays all existing tasks, sorted by due date.

- Show tasks for a given date: allows the user to see all tasks that are due on a given date.
